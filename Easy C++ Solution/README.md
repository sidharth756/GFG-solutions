## 📝 Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0. Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

### 🔢 Examples

**Input:**
```
 pos = 2, 
```
**Output:**
```
 4 
```
**Explanation:**
 There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4. 
**Input:**
```
 pos = 3, 
```
**Output:**
```
 3 
```
**Explanation:**
 The loop is from 19 to 10. So length of loop is 19 → 33 → 10 = 3. 
**Input:**
```
 pos = 0, 
```
**Output:**
```
 0 
```
**Explanation:**
 There is no loop.

### 📌 Constraints

```
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105 1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104 0 ≤ pos < number of nodes
```
